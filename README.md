### Data Contract & Guarantee

Every stage in this workflow communicates through validated data contracts:
* **No Mock Fallback in Live Mode:** In Live Model mode, the frontend exclusively queries the live FastAPI backend and GRU model. If the backend is unreachable, the system transparently reports `LIVE MODEL UNAVAILABLE` with connection diagnostics rather than masking the error with mock scenarios.
* **Real Measured Latency:** No synthetic or hardcoded latency is used. The backend records high-precision timing via `time.perf_counter()` for both model inference time (`~5-6 ms`) and total pipeline duration (`~40-50 ms`).
* **Zero Temporal Leakage:** Preprocessing and scaling parameters are strictly calculated on historic windows without future lookahead bias.

## 2. Problem Statement & Motivation

Traditional Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are inherently **reactive**:
1. They evaluate point-in-time flows or packet payloads *in isolation*.
2. They trigger alerts only after an attack has successfully progressed to high-impact exploitation (e.g., volumetric saturation or exfiltration).
3. They give SOC analysts near-zero lead time to contain malicious activity.

### The NetForecast AI Paradigm Shift

Complex intrusions follow multi-phase kill chains where initial precursor phases (scanning, enumeration, low-frequency beaconing) exhibit subtle temporal trends. NetForecast AI reframes security as a **temporal forecasting problem**:

$$\textbf{Observe Traffic} \longrightarrow \textbf{Learn Dynamics} \longrightarrow \textbf{Forecast State } (t+K) \longrightarrow \textbf{Map to MITRE} \longrightarrow \textbf{Preemptive Alert}$$

| Dimension | Traditional NIDS | NetForecast AI |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Inference Target** | Current state ($t$) | Future states across horizon ($t+1, \dots, t+K$) |
| **Input Structure** | Isolated flow or packet record | Continuous temporal sequence $[S_{t-T+1}, \dots, S_t]$ |
| **Classification** | Binary `Attack` vs. `Normal` | 4-Stage Security State + Quantitative Risk Score ($0-100$) |
| **Actionability** | Post-compromise incident response | Preemptive SOC containment prior to lateral impact |
| **Forecasting Horizon** | None ($K = 0$) | Configurable lookahead ($K = 3$ to $5$ windows) |

## 4. The 11-Stage End-to-End Pipeline

### Stage 1: Traffic Ingestion & Attack Simulation
Ingests raw NetFlow/IPFIX records, PCAP exports, or on-demand synthetic multi-stage scenarios:
* `normal`: Legitimate enterprise communications (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, SSH).
* `scanning`: Vertical and horizontal port enumeration sweeps.
* `syn_flood`: High-frequency TCP SYN packet flood with asymmetric completion.
* `ddos`: High-throughput distributed volumetric traffic saturation.
* `beaconing`: Periodic C2 heartbeats with consistent inter-arrival times.
* `udp_attack`: High-rate UDP datagram flood.
* `mixed_escalation`: Progressive ramp from normal baseline to full attack.
* `recovery`: Stepwise cool-down from active attack back to normal operations.

### Stage 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing ([`clean.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/preprocessing/clean.py))
* Chronological timestamp sorting to guarantee causal sequence alignment.
* Outlier clipping and missing-value imputation (forward fill and median baseline).
* Protocol standardization and port range categorization.

### Stage 3: Cyber Feature Engineering ([`feature_extraction.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/preprocessing/feature_extraction.py))
Extracts the **Core 7 Time-Series Features** consumed by the GRU World Model:
1. `flow_duration`: Duration of network connection in seconds.
2. `packet_count`: Total packets transmitted in the window.
3. `byte_count`: Total volume transferred in bytes.
4. `packet_rate`: Packet velocity ($\text{packets} / \text{sec}$).
5. `byte_rate`: Bandwidth throughput ($\text{bytes} / \text{sec}$).
6. `inter_arrival_time`: Delta between consecutive packets.
7. `connection_frequency`: Active connection initiation frequency.

Additional domain features extracted include Shannon entropy for destination ports and source IPs, SYN/ACK ratios, and host continuity flags.

### Stage 4: Topological Network Graph ([`network_graph.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/graph/network_graph.py))
Builds directed graph $G_t = (V, E)$ for each window:
* **Nodes ($V$):** Internal and external IP endpoints.
* **Edges ($E$):** Active network flows weighted by byte count and protocol.
* **Metrics:** Degree centrality, density, clustering coefficients, and star score (detecting centralized scanning hubs and C2 controllers).

### Stage 5: Temporal Windowing ([`windowing.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/preprocessing/windowing.py))
Constructs overlapping temporal matrices with sliding sequence length $T=20$ and feature dimension $F=7$. Zero future data is exposed during windowing.

### Stage 6: AI World Model Inference ([`lstm.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/models/temporal/lstm.py))
Executes the trained `NetworkStateGRU` PyTorch model:
* **Encoder:** 2-layer GRU (hidden dimension 128, dropout 0.3) preceded by $\log(1+x)$ normalization.
* **Head A (Current State):** Classifies the observed window into security states.
* **Head B (Next State):** Forecasts the expected security state for step $t+1$.

### Stage 7: K-Step Lookahead Forecasting ([`prediction_engine.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/prediction/prediction_engine.py))
Projects future trajectories over $K=3$ future horizons ($+5\text{s}, +10\text{s}, +15\text{s}$) combining GRU probability outputs with state dynamics, calculating decaying confidence margins:

$$\text{Confidence}_{t+k} = \max\left(0.10, \;\text{Confidence}_t - k \times 0.08\right)$$

### Stage 8: Threat & Risk Scoring ([`risk_scorer.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/prediction/risk_scorer.py))
Computes a compound $0-100$ threat score:

$$\text{Score} = 0.45 \times \text{StateSeverity} + 0.35 \times \text{AnomalyPoints} + 0.20 \times \text{PersistenceScore}$$

* **$0 - 29$:** LOW Risk (Normal baseline activity)
* **$30 - 59$:** MEDIUM Risk (Elevated reconnaissance)
* **$60 - 79$:** HIGH Risk (Suspicious staging / C2 activity)
* **$80 - 100$:** CRITICAL Risk (Active attack / Volumetric impact)

### Stage 9: MITRE ATT&CK Mapping ([`attack_mapping.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/mitre/attack_mapping.py))
Automatically correlates detected and forecasted stages to official MITRE Enterprise ATT&CK techniques:
* `T1046`: Network Service Discovery (Port Scanning)
* `T1595`: Active Scanning (IP sweeps)
* `T1110`: Brute Force Authentication
* `T1021`: Remote Services (Lateral Movement)
* `T1071`: Application Layer Protocol (C2 Beaconing)
* `T1048`: Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol
* `T1498`: Network Denial of Service (SYN / UDP Flooding)
* `T1486`: Data Encrypted for Impact

### Stage 10: Explainable AI ([`shap_analysis.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/explainability/shap_analysis.py))
Calculates feature attribution weights to identify the exact telemetry indicators driving the forecast and generates natural-language explanations for SOC analysts.

### Stage 11: Alert & SOC Playbook Generation ([`alert_engine.py`](file:///c:/Users/Nagarjuna%20N/Desktop/sih%20hackton/network-attack-forecasting/prediction/alert_engine.py))
Generates structured early-warning alerts whenever the threat score exceeds the threshold ($35$), packaging the alert with MITRE IDs, observed evidence, and actionable containment playbooks.

## 5. AI World Model & Forecasting Engine

The primary model is a **Dual-Head Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)** configured as follows:

```text
Input Tensor: (Batch, T=20, F=7)
       │
       ▼
Log1p Normalisation  ──▶  GRU Layer 1 (Hidden 128)  ──▶  Dropout (0.3)
                                  │
                                  ▼
                          GRU Layer 2 (Hidden 128)
                                  │
                                  ▼
                        Final Hidden State (128)
                                  │
                 ┌────────────────┴────────────────┐
                 ▼                                 ▼
         [ HEAD A: Current ]              [ HEAD B: Next State ]
        Linear(128 → 64) + ReLU          Linear(128 → 64) + ReLU
        Linear(64 → 4) + LogSoftmax      Linear(64 → 4) + LogSoftmax
                 │                                 │
                 ▼                                 ▼
       P(State_t | X_<=t)                P(State_t+1 | X_<=t)
```

### Why GRU for Network Telemetry?
* **Low Inference Latency:** GRU converges with fewer parameters than LSTM and Transformers, delivering a measured **$5-6\text{ ms}$** forward pass on standard CPUs.
* **Short-to-Medium Horizon Stability:** Network state sequences ($10-30$ time steps) benefit from the gating mechanism without suffering gradient decay.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Head A and Head B have independent linear projections, cleanly isolating "what is happening now" from "what will happen next".

---

## 6. Threat Scoring & State Transition Ladder

The internal security state machine enforces an escalating and recovering transition ladder:

$$\textbf{NORMAL} \;\rightleftharpoons\; \textbf{ELEVATED} \;\rightleftharpoons\; \textbf{SUSPICIOUS} \;\rightleftharpoons\; \textbf{ATTACK}$$

### State Ladder Characteristics

| State | Typical Traffic Signal | Attack Stage Mapping | Baseline Threat Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NORMAL** | Standard web, DNS, API traffic | Baseline Operations | $0 - 20$ |
| **ELEVATED** | Port sweeps, high destination port entropy | Reconnaissance, Scanning | $21 - 45$ |
| **SUSPICIOUS** | Low-frequency periodic beacons, bursty connections | Initial Access, C2 Channel | $46 - 70$ |
| **ATTACK** | Packet floods, extreme throughput, SYN asymmetry | Lateral Movement, Impact | $71 - 100$ |

### Recovery Transition Mechanics
When attack traffic ceases and normal baseline traffic returns, the system does not invent artificial states. The state machine transitions downward through history, acknowledging recovery explicitly:

$$\text{ATTACK } (t=1, \text{Score } 95) \;\longrightarrow\; \text{NORMAL } (t=2, \text{Stage: Recovery}, \text{Score } 8) \;\longrightarrow\; \text{NORMAL } (t=3, \text{Stage: Baseline}, \text{Score } 2)$$
